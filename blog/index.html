                    <h3>For translators</h3>
                    <h4>Focus on translation</h4>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/blog/2017-01/transunit.png" alt="translation unit">
                    <p>Zanata handles the entire workflow so translators can focus on translating,
                        not on tools or formats:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zanata's Editor works on any computer with a web browser; no installation
                            is needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Translations can be written in Zanata without the need to work with
                            version control systems, esoteric document formats or confusing email
                            workflows.
                        </li>
                        <li>Zanata's User Dashboard provides a shortcut to jump between jobs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Plurals are handled natively in Zanata's Editor.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Work together</h4>
                    <p>Multiple translators can work on the same document using Zanata's Editor.
                        This provides a range of features to help translators work together
                        effectively:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Translations are visible to all translators as soon as they are saved.
                        </li>
                        <li>Markers indicate when a passage is being edited by other translators.
                        </li>
                        <li>Users are alerted if a conflict occurs to prevent work being lost.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each language in the project has a chat room for real time communication.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>High quality suggestions</h4>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/blog/2017-01/tm.png" alt="translation memory">
                    <p>Translators can avoid writing the same translation twice by using Zanata's
                        Translation Memory (TM). Zanata's TM is a powerful tool for translation
                        reuse:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The TM finds the best translation matches out of all the translations
                            in the whole system.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is built into Zanata's Editor, allowing a streamlined workflow.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is updated in real time to allow instant reuse.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each page of translations can be easily pre-filled with the best translation
                            matches.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Information at your fingertips</h4>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/blog/2017-01/transhistory.png"
                         alt="translation history">
                    <p>Zanata's Editor provides easy access to a range of useful information
                        so that translators can work without disruptive context changes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zanata shows live translation statistics and remaining work estimation
                            for each document and the whole project, updated in real time.
                        </li>
                        <li>Syntax highlighting is available to support technical translations.
                        </li>
                        <li>History for each translation can be accessed with a single click, to
                            quickly see when it was changed and reviewed.
                        </li>
                        <li>A glossary is integrated into the editor for a convenient explanation
                            of terms.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Support for high quality translations</h4>
                    <p>Zanata's Editor provides a set of features to support high translation
                        quality:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Validators run as translations are typed in the Editor, immediately
                            reporting common mistakes and problematic items.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Editor's review workflow provides a way to view all translations
                            and ensure they are consistent.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can replace words through every document in a project with full
                            control. The review and undo tools allow you to easily and confidently
                            update terminology and fix mistakes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Writers and Developers</h3>
                    <h4>Automated Workflows</h4>
                    <p>Zanata’s command-line client is easily integrated into scripts and used
                        in continuous integration. A Maven plugin is supplied that can support
                        both simple and multi-module Maven projects. Zanata also has a REST
                        API for scripting and integration with other tools.</p>
                    <h4>Translation Reuse</h4>
                    <p>Zanata can automatically copy matching translations from its translation
                        memory to any text you upload, using your configured rules to ensure
                        quality matches.</p>
                    <h4>Quality Control</h4>
                    <p>Ensure that translations can never break your build by enforcing relevant
                        validations. Easily add a review phase to your project to ensure translations
                        are to a high standard. Upload your existing translations and translation
                        memory to Zanata to keep translations consistent. Use project groups
                        to source translations from other users.</p>
                    <h4>Major Formats Supported</h4>
                    <p>Zanata supports common translation formats for documentation and software.
                        Supported formats include Gettext Portable Object (.po), Java Properties
                        (.properties), XLIFF, Mozilla DTD, LibreOffice (.odt .fodt .odp .fodp
                        .ods .fods .odg .fodg .odb .odf) and plain text (.txt). Zanata allows
                        translation of .po files offline, preserving translator credits and
                        using a smart merge algorithm for uploaded translations.</p>
