## Processing Membership Requests (for Coordinators)

When a user requests membership in a language team that you coordinate, you will receive an email with the details of their request. It is up to your professional judgement whether to add a user to your language team, based on the information they provide and any prior knowledge you have of their translation ability.

To add the user to a language team:

 1. Click `Add Team Member` on the right.
 1. type the username for the user and click `Search`.

 1. Click `Add Selected`.
 1. Click `Close`.

You can update the user's roles within the language team any time using the checkboxes in the table of members.

Once a user has been added, please reply to the request email to inform them that they can begin translating in your language.
