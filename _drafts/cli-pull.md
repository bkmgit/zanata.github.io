To download documents from your project-version, the command-line client's `pull` command can be used.

These instructions assume that you have installed {{ site.cli_client_name }} as shown in [Installing the Client]({{ site.url }}/help/cli/cli-install), and have saved user and project configuration as shown in [Configuring the Client][].

[Configuring the Client]: {{ site.url }}/help/cli/cli-configuration


## Translation Document Download

The basic command for downloading documents is `{{ site.cli_client_name }} pull`. The pull command should always be run from the directory that contains `zanata.xml` for your project (find information about `zanata.xml` at [Configuring the Client][]).
