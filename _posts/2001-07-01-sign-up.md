You can create an account on Zanata using an OpenID login (such as Google or Fedora), or by creating a password just for Zanata. If you want to sign in a different way later, you can set or change your password and add OpenID logins to your account at any time.

*Note: These instructions are for translate.zanata.org. If you want to use translate.jboss.org, use a jboss.org account. You can create a jboss.org account at the [jboss.org registration page](https://community.jboss.org/register.jspa).*

## Sign Up using OpenId

To create an account using OpenID:

 1. Click `Login` at the top right.
 2. Select your OpenID type or enter an OpenID url.
 3. Confirm with your OpenID provider.
 4. When you are returned to Zanata, enter your display name, a username and make sure your email address is entered correctly.
 5. Click `Save`.
 6. Find the validation email that is sent to you and click the validation link in the email.

From now on you should then be able to sign in to Zanata any time using your OpenID.


## Sign Up with a New Password

If you want to use a separate password for Zanata, rather than registering with an OpenID:

 1. Click `Sign Up` at the top right.
 2. Enter your display name, email address and other details.
 3. Click `Register`
 4. Find the validation email that is sent to you and click the validation link in the email.

From now on you should then be able to sign in to Zanata any time using the username and the password you entered in step 2.


## Adding a Password

If you have registered with OpenID, you can still set up a password and sign in directly. To set a password, click `Change Password` under your profile settings and enter the desired password.


## Adding OpenID logins

You can link your account to OpenID logins after it is created. It is possible to have several different logins linked to the same account and sign in with any of them.

To add an OpenID login to your account, use `Manage Identities` under your profile settings.

*Note: if you want to tranalate a project that falls under Fedora CLA, you must add a Fedora OpenID to your account. Once added, you should be able to sign in with your password or any OpenID and will be allowed to translate Fedora projects.*
