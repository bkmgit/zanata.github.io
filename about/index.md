Zanata is a web-based system for managing localisation projects. Localisation (L10n) is the process of translating software or documentation into the various local languages used around the world.

Zanata is written in Java and uses modern web technologies like JBoss, Seam, GWT, Hibernate, and a REST API. It currently supports translation of software through Gettext/PO, Java Properties and XLIFF (partial), and DocBook/Publican documentation through PO files. Projects can be uploaded to and downloaded from a Zanata server using a Maven plugin or a Python client.

A public instance of Zanata is hosted at translate.zanata.org and is ready to accept content from open source projects for translation.

For projects hosted at jboss.org, please use the JBoss instance of Zanata at [translate.jboss.org](translate.jboss.org).

Zanata is free software, licensed under the LGPL.

For more information, see the Zanata Quick Start Guide and other documentation.
