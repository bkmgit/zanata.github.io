<p class="txt--lead">Zanata is a web-based translation platform for managing localization projects. Localization (L10n) is the process of translating software or documentation into different languages.</p>

Zanata is written in Java and uses modern web technologies such as JBoss, Seam, GWT, ReactJS and Hibernate. It also presents a REST API. 
It currently supports software and documentation translation of various file types. See [here](http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/user-guide/projects/project-types/#supported-types) for supported file types in Zanata.
Projects can be uploaded to and downloaded from a Zanata server using a Maven plugin or a command-line client.

A public instance of Zanata is hosted on [https://translate.zanata.org](https://translate.zanata.org) which accepts content from open source projects for translation.

For projects hosted on jboss.org, use the JBoss instance of Zanata at [translate.jboss.org](http://translate.jboss.org).

Zanata is free software licensed under the LGPL.
