  <h3>Cookies and Other Browser Information</h3>
  <p>
    Zanata's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP
    addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our
    website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our
    services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in
    order to provide you data and content from our services as quickly as
    possible. It is in Zanata’s legitimate business interest to maximize the
    efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services,
    Zanata uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A
    cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web
    server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of Zanata
    where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your
    browser to accept cookies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, we use cookies to:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="l--push-v-1">Remind us of who you are and to access your account
      information (stored on our computers) in order to provide a better and
      more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "sign
      in" and is modified when you "sign out" of our services.
    </li>
    <li class="l--push-v-1">Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing
      Zanata is given a unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of
      repeat usage and usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered
      user.
    </li>
    <li class="l--push-v-1">Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of
      Zanata's network of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns
      in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our user's habits
      are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new
      experience on Zanata a better one. We may use this information to better
      personalize the content, banners, and promotions you and other users will
      see on our sites.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you
    can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks
    you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that
    the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and
    choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of
    the site. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to
    enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in
    the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" facility).
  </p>

  <h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>
  <p>
    Zanata trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and makes
    our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you send your
    personal information on our website. In addition, Zanata and its partners
    enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and
    precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal
    data.
  </p>
  <h3>Public Forums Reminder</h3>
  <p>
    Zanata often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists available to its users.
    Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas
    becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your
    personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free
    expression, Zanata reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve
    the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or
    inappropriate. It is in Zanata’s legitimate business interests to provide
    all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public
    forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and
    content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an
    environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the
    development and propagation of open source software.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    Out of special concern for children's privacy, Zanata does not knowingly
    accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. Zanata
    does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered
    members of our sites. Zanata does not knowingly collect or solicit personal
    information about children under 13.
  </p>
  <p>In the event that Zanata ever decides to expand its intended site audience
    to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in
    accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection
    Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice
    addressed to children under 13. In addition, Zanata will provide an
    appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to
    subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal
    information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.
  </p>
